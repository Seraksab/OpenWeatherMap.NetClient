[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/OpenWeatherMap.NetClient?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenWeatherMap.NetClient)

A simple, asynchronous .NET client to fetch weather information from
the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) APIs.

Support for response caching is built in.  
Numerical values are parsed to and returned as units from [Units.NET](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet)
(where applicable) to ease the conversion between different measurement systems and avoid unit confusion.

Currently supported APIs:

* [Current Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current) - Current weather data for any location on Earth including over
  200,000 cities
* [Geocoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) - Tool to ease the search for locations while working with
  geographic names and coordinates
* [Air Pollution](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution) - Provides current, forecast and historical air
  pollution data for any coordinates on the globe

## Installation

OpenWeatherMap.NetClient is available from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenWeatherMap.NetClient)

## Usage

Creating a client is as simple as just passing in your Api Key to the constructor.

```csharp
var client = new OpenWeatherMapClient("[API_KEY]");

// querying the current weather for a location based on name
var weatherResponse = await client.CurrentWeather.QueryAsync("Linz,AT");
if (weatherResponse.IsSuccess)
{
  var content = weatherResponse.Content;
  Console.Out.WriteLine($"The current weather in Linz is '{content.WeatherDescription}' " +
                        $"at {content.Temperature.DegreesCelsius}Â°C");
}

// querying the current air pollution for geographical coordinates
var airPollutionResponse = await client.AirPollution.QueryCurrentAsync(48.3059, 14.2862);
if (airPollutionResponse.IsSuccess)
{
  var aqi = airPollutionResponse.Content.AirQualityIndex;
  Console.Out.WriteLine($"The current air quality index is '{aqi.ToString()}'");
}
```

### Client configuration

Caching is disabled by default.  
The default cache duration is set to 10 minutes (if cache is enabled).  
The default  culture is set to 'en'.

You can modify the default configuration of the client by additionally passing _IOpenWeatherMapOptions_

```csharp
var client = new OpenWeatherMapClient("[API_KEY]", new OpenWeatherMapOptions
{
  Culture = new CultureInfo("en"),
  CacheEnabled = true,
  CacheDuration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)
});
```
